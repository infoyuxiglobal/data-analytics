    "  * Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed, advanced and expressive scripting language\n",
    "  * Syntactically, it belongs to the  in the Algol/Pascal/C family of languages.\n",
    "  * Semantically, it is perhaps closes to Lisp.\n",
    "  * The Python philosofy emphasizes **readability of code as well as elegance and simplicity of syntax**, \n",
    "     * e.g. words preferred to symbolic operators, no curly braces, no semicolons and most notably, **blocks delimited by identation!**\n",
    "  * Prototyping a solution can be done 5 - 10 faster in Python than in C/C++ and 3-5 faster than in Java\n",
    "  * Some describe Python as **executable pseudocode**, meaning it's almost as simple to write a Python program as it is to sketch it in plain english  \n",
    "  * Python is advertised as **batteries included**. Its very extensive [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) makes it easy to perform common tasks such as: reading and modifying text files (an other types), using regular expressions, doing http requests, setting up a simple http server, implementing desktop GUIs, **interfacing with databases**, **doing data mangling**, **machine learning**, **deep learning**, etc... \n",
    "  * Python and its standard library are [wonderfully documented](https://docs.python.org/3/)\n",
    "  * Python can be used as a [**glue language**](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/omg-darpa-mcc-position/).\n",
    "  * Python **supports object orientation**, and most libraries use it, but it is not a core feature of the language. It's quite posible to write all python code in a *purely procedural or functional style*, and sometimes it is even preferable to do so!\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Nobody is perfect...\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Python, in it's default interpreted implementation, is rather **slow** (about 20 times as slow as a pure C implementation) However... \n",
    "      * It can be easily extended with C/C++ written modules that implement the performance critical parts of the application. For example, for numerical work / matrix computations there is the 'numpy' library. \n",
    "      *  There is an superset language called Cython which is syntactically very similar to Python but with some of C's features, such as static variable type declarations. By using Python it is easy to write C-speed extension modules that can easily be imported from Python.\n",
    "      *  There are also some compilable implementations of Python, such as [PyPy](https://pypy.org/). \n"

Always use Python-aware editors, such as the Spyder IDE that is included with Anaconda or Visual Studio Code with the Python plugin installed. When using those make sure to *always* name your Python source code files with '.py' extension, so that the editor knows that you are writing a Python script or module.  "
